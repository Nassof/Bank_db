## Bank DB (Datacamp project)

## Objective: 
Clean and store the data that was collected during a recent marketing campaign, which aimed to get customers to take out a personal loan. 
The exercice is to set up a PostgreSQL database to store this campaign's data, designing the schema in a way that would allow data from future campaigns to be easily imported.

"bank_marketing.csv", needs to be cleaned, reformat, and split, in order to save separate files based on the tables created. `pandas` will be used for these tasks.

Lastly, SQL code will be provided so that the bank can execute to create the tables and populate with the data from the csv files. 

As the bank are quite strict about their security, the SQL files are presented as multiline string variables in order to be used to create a database.

### Design a database with three tables:

### client 

| column | data type | description | original column in dataset |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| `id` | `serial` | Client ID - primary key | `client_id` |
| `age` | `integer` | Client's age in years | `age` |
| `job` | `text` | Client's type of job | `job` |
| `marital` | `text` | Client's marital status | `marital` | 
| `education` | `text` | Client's level of education | `education` |
| `credit_default` | `boolean` | Whether the client's credit is in default | `credit_default` |
| `housing` | `boolean` | Whether the client has an existing housing loan (mortgage) | `housing` | 
| `loan` | `boolean` | Whether the client has an existing perasonal loan | `loan` |


### campaign

| column | data type | description | original column in dataset |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| `campaign_id` | `serial` | Campaign ID - primary key | N/A - new column |
| `client_id` | `serial` | Client ID - references `id` in the `client` table | `client_id` |
| `number_contacts` | `integer` | Number of contact attempts to the client in the current campaign | `campaign` |
| `contact_duration` | `integer` | Last contact duration in seconds | `duration` |
| `pdays` | `integer` | Number of days since contact in previous campaign (`999` = not previously contacted) | `pdays` |
| `previous_campaign_contacts` | `integer` | Number of contact attempts to the client in the previous campaign | `previous` |
| `previous_outcome` | `boolean` | Outcome of the previous campaign | `poutcome` |
| `campaign_outcome` | `boolean` | Outcome of the current campaign | `y` |
| `last_contact_date` | `date` | Last date the client was contacted | A combination of `day`, `month`, and the newly created `year` |


### economics 

| column | data type | description | original column in dataset |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| `client_id` | `serial` | Client ID - references `id` in the `client` table | `client_id` |
| `emp_var_rate` | `float` | Employment variation rate (quarterly indicator) | `emp_var_rate` |
| `cons_price_idx` | `float` | Consumer price index (monthly indicator) | `cons_price_idx` |
| `euribor_three_months` | `float` | Euro Interbank Offered Rate (euribor) three month rate (daily indicator) | `euribor3m` |
| `number_employed` | `float` | Number of employees (quarterly indicator)| `nr_employed` |
